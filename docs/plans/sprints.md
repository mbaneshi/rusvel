# RUSVEL — Consolidated Sprint Plan

> Single source of truth. All other plan docs are reference material.
> Date: 2026-03-25 | Status: Active | Updated: 2026-03-26

**Parallel initiative:** [program-harvest-agency.md](program-harvest-agency.md) — native harvest / autonomous agency (waves, priorities, AG-1…7 slices, Cursor todo map). Orthogonal to Sprint 2–5 below.

---

## Where We Are (verified 2026-03-27)

**Build:** `cargo build` clean (0 errors). `cargo test` 0 failures in full local run.

**Metrics glossary:** [`docs/status/current-state.md`](../status/current-state.md) — **54** workspace members, **~68,443** LOC in `crates/*.rs`, **293** Rust files under `crates/`, **~635** tests (workspace sum), **~100** test targets from `cargo test --no-run`, **141** `.route(` chains in `rusvel-api/src/lib.rs`, **36** API handler modules (excluding `lib.rs`). Older docs used different counts; use **§1** in `current-state` only.

**Git:** See working tree; not tracked here.
