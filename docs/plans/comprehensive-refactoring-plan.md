## 1. Executive summary

RUSVEL's hexagonal architecture is fundamentally sound. The port/adapter boundary, DepartmentApp plugin pattern (ADR-014), and composition root are correctly implemented. This plan does not propose replacing the architecture — it proposes **hardening** it with industry-standard design patterns to maximize extensibility, eliminate runtime errors that could be compile-time errors, and prepare the system for scale.

**Three strategic themes:**

1. **Type safety over stringly-typed** — Replace magic strings (event kinds, job kinds, tool names, department IDs) with compile-time-safe alternatives where possible, and validated registries where not.
2. **GoF patterns as Rust idioms** — Apply Builder (typestate), Strategy (trait generics), Observer (typed channels), Decorator (tower layers), Command (enum dispatch), and Visitor (AST traversal) where they eliminate boilerplate or catch bugs.
3. **Scalability substrate** — Add saga orchestration to flow-engine, association graphs to ObjectStore, reflection-based self-improvement loops, and Tower Service composability to the agent runtime.

**What is NOT changing:** The hexagonal port/adapter boundary, DepartmentApp trait, composition root pattern, single-binary constraint, SQLite WAL backend, or any ADR decisions.

## 2. Current architecture assessment

### Patterns already in use (verified)

| GoF Pattern | Where | Quality |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Strategy** | Port traits (LlmPort, AgentPort, StoragePort) | Excellent — runtime dispatch via `Arc<dyn Trait>` |
| **Abstract Factory** | Composition root (`rusvel-app/src/main.rs`) | Excellent — wires all adapters |
| **Facade** | `AgentRuntime` over LlmPort+ToolPort+MemoryPort (ADR-009) | Excellent |
| **Adapter** | Every `rusvel-*` adapter crate | Excellent — clean port/adapter boundary |
| **Proxy** | `ScopedToolRegistry` filters tools per department | Good |
| **Observer** | `AgentEvent` over mpsc; `EventPort` broadcast | Good |
| **Command** | `JobKind` enum dispatch in worker; `ToolHandler` closures | Good |
| **Bridge** | Port traits separate abstraction from implementation | Excellent |
| **Flyweight** | `Arc<dyn Port>` shared across engines | Good |
| **Builder** | `DepartmentManifest::new()`, `LlmRequest` construction | Partial — no typestate |
| **Template Method** | `LlmPort::stream()` default calls `generate()` | Good |
| **Singleton** | `Arc<T>` passed at construction (no static globals) | Excellent |

### Patterns missing or incomplete

| Pattern | Gap | Impact |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Typestate Builder** | No compile-time enforcement of required fields | Runtime panics on misconfiguration |
| **Decorator (tower)** | `CostTrackingLlm` wraps manually, not as composable Layer | Can't stack middleware on LlmPort/AgentPort |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Axum middleware is flat, no per-route middleware chain | All routes share same middleware |
| **Visitor** | `code-engine` symbol graph has no visitor trait | Adding new analysis = modifying traversal code |
| **State (typestate)** | Job/Flow status as runtime enum, not compile-time states | Invalid transitions possible at runtime |
| **Memento** | No checkpoint/snapshot pattern for flow-engine | Flows restart from zero on failure |
| **Mediator** | No cross-department coordination beyond events | ForgeEngine can't delegate to other dept agents |
| **Interpreter** | Flow condition nodes use ad-hoc evaluation | No formal expression language |

### Structural issues identified

| Issue | Location | Severity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Monolithic `AppState` (~25 fields) | `rusvel-api/src/lib.rs` | High — hard to test, implicit coupling |
| Tool name collisions not validated | `rusvel-tool` ToolRegistrar | High — silent overwrite |
| Event kinds stringly-typed | All engines | Medium — typos undetected |
| Job results stored in metadata | `rusvel-jobs` | Medium — type-unsafe |
| No association graph between domain objects | `ObjectStore` | Medium — no Contact↔Opportunity links |
| Magic numbers scattered | Agent loop (10), compaction (30), broadcast (256) | Low — no central config |
| Worker polling has no shutdown signal | `rusvel-jobs` spawn_worker | Medium — can't gracefully stop |
| CORS origins hardcoded | `rusvel-api` | Low — not configurable |
| CLI department variants repeated 9 times | `rusvel-cli` | Low — DRY violation |

## 3. Concept hierarchy — the domain model spine

This section defines the **hierarchy of concepts** that all refactoring must preserve and strengthen. This is RUSVEL's ontology — the backbone that every pattern, every crate, and every API route maps onto.

### Level 0: Platform

```
RUSVEL (Platform)
├── Identity: single binary, single human, infinite leverage
├── Constraint: SQLite WAL, tokio async, Rust + SvelteKit
└── Invariant: every action traceable to a Session
```

### Level 1: Session → Workspace

```
Session
├── Owns: Runs, Threads, Goals, Events, Jobs, Config overrides
├── Scopes: All state is session-namespaced
├── Lifecycle: create → active → archived
└── Future: Session becomes Workspace when multi-user
```

### Level 2: Departments (Bounded Contexts)

```
Department (DepartmentApp)
├── Identity: string ID, manifest, icon, color
├── Owns: Engine, Tools, Skills, Rules, Hooks, Agents, Workflows
├── Communicates via: Events (pub/sub), Jobs (async work), ObjectStore (shared state)
├── Never: imports another department's crate
└── Types:
    ├── Wired (6): forge, code, harvest, content, gtm, flow
    ├── Skeleton (7): finance, product, growth, distro, legal, support, infra
    └── Shell (1): messaging (no engine crate yet)
```

### Level 3: Domain Entities (per department)

```
Forge: Goal → Task → Plan → Review → Persona → AgentProfile
Code: Repository → SymbolGraph → Symbol → Metric → SearchResult
Harvest: Opportunity → Proposal → Pipeline → Source → Score
Content: ContentItem → CalendarEntry → PlatformAdapter → PublishResult
GTM: Contact → Deal → OutreachSequence → Step → Invoice
Flow: Workflow → Node → Edge → Execution → Checkpoint → NodeResult
Finance: Ledger → Transaction → TaxEstimate → RunwayForecast
Product: Roadmap → Feature → PricingTier → FeedbackItem
Growth: Funnel → Cohort → KPI → Experiment
Distro: Listing → SEOProfile → AffiliateProgram → Partnership
Legal: Contract → ComplianceCheck → IPRecord → LicenseAgreement
Support: Ticket → KBArticle → NPSSurvey → AutoTriageRule
Infra: Deployment → Monitor → Incident → Pipeline
```

### Level 4: Cross-cutting Primitives

```
Event (immutable, append-only, kind=String)
Job (queue item: Queued → Running → Succeeded/Failed/AwaitingApproval)
Tool (registered capability: name, schema, handler, permission)
Skill (stored prompt template with {{input}} interpolation)
Rule (injected system prompt fragment per engine)
Hook (trigger: command/http/prompt on event match)
Agent (LLM + tools + persona + memory, streaming via AgentEvent)
Approval (human gate on Job or content publishing)
```

### Level 5: Infrastructure Ports

```
LlmPort → raw model access (generate, stream, embed)
AgentPort → orchestrated LLM (tool loop, memory, verification)
StoragePort → 5 sub-stores (events, objects, sessions, jobs, metrics)
EventPort → pub/sub + persistence
JobPort → central async work queue
ToolPort → tool registry + execution + permission
MemoryPort → session-scoped context + FTS5 search
ConfigPort → layered settings (global → dept → session)
AuthPort → opaque credential handles
EmbeddingPort → text → dense vectors
VectorStorePort → similarity search
ChannelPort → outbound notifications (Telegram, Discord)
TerminalPort → PTY multiplexer
BrowserPort → Chrome DevTools Protocol
DeployPort → deployment operations
SessionPort → session lifecycle management
```

### Design principle: Concept ownership

Every concept belongs to exactly one level. Cross-level references use IDs (newtypes), never owned structs. A Department never owns a Session. A Session never owns a Department. They reference each other via `SessionId` and department string ID.

**Refactoring rule:** If a struct holds an owned reference to a concept from a different level, it must be refactored to hold an ID reference instead.

## 4. Gang of Four patterns — Rust-idiomatic application

### 4.1 Creational patterns

#### Builder with Typestate (GoF: Builder)

**Problem:** `DepartmentManifest`, `LlmRequest`, `AgentConfig`, `FlowDefinition` are constructed with many fields. Missing required fields cause runtime panics or silent defaults.

**Solution:** Typestate builder pattern — encode required fields as generic type parameters. The `build()` method is only available when all required fields are set.

**Target types:**

```
[ ] DepartmentManifest — require id, name, system_prompt before build()
[ ] LlmRequest — require model and messages before build()
[ ] AgentConfig — require session_id and system_prompt before build()
[ ] FlowDefinition — require at least one node before build()
[ ] WebhookRegistration — require name, event_kind, and secret before build()
```

**Rust pattern:**

```rust
// Zero-sized state markers
pub struct NoId;
pub struct HasId(String);
pub struct NoPrompt;
pub struct HasPrompt(String);

pub struct ManifestBuilder<Id, Prompt> {
    id: Id,
    prompt: Prompt,
    name: String,
    // ... optional fields with defaults
}

impl ManifestBuilder<NoId, NoPrompt> {
    pub fn new(name: impl Into<String>) -> Self { /* defaults */ }
}

impl<Prompt> ManifestBuilder<NoId, Prompt> {
    pub fn id(self, id: impl Into<String>) -> ManifestBuilder<HasId, Prompt> { /* move fields */ }
}

impl<Id> ManifestBuilder<Id, NoPrompt> {
    pub fn system_prompt(self, p: impl Into<String>) -> ManifestBuilder<Id, HasPrompt> { /* move */ }
}

impl ManifestBuilder<HasId, HasPrompt> {
    pub fn build(self) -> DepartmentManifest { /* only callable when both set */ }
}
```

**Scope:** 5 types across `rusvel-core`, `rusvel-agent`, `flow-engine`, `rusvel-webhook`.

---

#### Abstract Factory (GoF: Abstract Factory) — Composition Root Hardening

**Problem:** `rusvel-app/src/main.rs` constructs 25+ adapters with ad-hoc wiring. No structured validation that all required ports are provided.

**Solution:** Introduce a `PlatformFactory` trait that encapsulates adapter construction. The composition root becomes a concrete factory. Test harnesses become alternative factories.

```rust
pub trait PlatformFactory {
    fn create_storage(&self) -> Result<Arc<dyn StoragePort>>;
    fn create_llm(&self) -> Result<Arc<dyn LlmPort>>;
    fn create_agent(&self, llm: Arc<dyn LlmPort>, tools: Arc<dyn ToolPort>, memory: Arc<dyn MemoryPort>) -> Result<Arc<dyn AgentPort>>;
    fn create_event_bus(&self, store: Arc<dyn EventStore>) -> Result<Arc<dyn EventPort>>;
    // ... one method per required port
}

pub struct ProductionFactory { config: AppConfig }
pub struct TestFactory { /* in-memory everything */ }
```

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Define PlatformFactory trait in rusvel-core (or a new rusvel-factory crate)
[ ] Implement ProductionFactory in rusvel-app
[ ] Implement TestFactory replacing rusvel-api/tests/common/mod.rs TestHarness ad-hoc construction
[ ] Validate: all required ports constructed before boot_departments() is called
```

---

#### Registry Pattern (GoF: not directly — combines Factory + Singleton)

**Problem:** Tool names, event kinds, job kinds, and department IDs are stringly-typed. Collisions are silent. Typos are undetected.

**Solution:** Validated registries with collision detection at registration time.

```
[ ] ToolRegistry: fail-fast on duplicate tool name registration
    - Change internal storage from allowing silent overwrite to returning Err on collision
    - Add deregister() for cleanup

[ ] EventKindRegistry (new): departments declare events_produced in manifest
    - At boot: collect all event kinds from manifests
    - At subscription: validate event kind exists in registry
    - Warn on unregistered event kind emission (log, don't fail — for extensibility)

[ ] JobKindRegistry (new): departments declare job kinds in manifest
    - At boot: collect all job kinds, validate no duplicate handlers
    - At dispatch: validate job kind has a registered handler

[ ] DepartmentIdRegistry: already exists via boot validation
    - Strengthen: validate IDs are valid URL slugs (lowercase, no spaces, no special chars)
```

---

### 4.2 Structural patterns

#### Decorator via Tower Layers (GoF: Decorator)

**Problem:** Cross-cutting concerns (cost tracking, rate limiting, retry, timeout, logging) are applied inconsistently. `CostTrackingLlm` wraps `LlmPort` manually. No composable middleware for ports.

**Solution:** Define port operations as `tower::Service` where middleware composition is needed. Wrap with `tower::Layer` for cross-cutting concerns.

**Target ports:**

```
[ ] LlmPort operations as tower::Service
    - CostTrackingLayer — wraps any LlmPort, accumulates cost
    - RateLimitLayer — per-provider rate limiting
    - RetryLayer — retry on transient errors with exponential backoff
    - TimeoutLayer — per-request timeout
    - LoggingLayer — structured tracing for LLM calls

    Composition:
    ServiceBuilder::new()
        .layer(LoggingLayer)
        .layer(TimeoutLayer::new(Duration::from_secs(30)))
        .layer(RetryLayer::new(3))
        .layer(RateLimitLayer::new(10, Duration::from_secs(1)))
        .layer(CostTrackingLayer::new(metrics.clone()))
        .service(OllamaProvider::new(url))

[ ] AgentPort as tower::Service<AgentRequest, Response = AgentStream>
    - ConcurrencyLimitLayer — max simultaneous agent runs
    - BackpressureLayer — bounded channel, reject when full
    - TimeoutLayer — max agent run duration

[ ] ToolPort::call() as tower::Service<ToolRequest, Response = ToolResult>
    - PermissionLayer — check tool permissions before dispatch
    - ValidationLayer — validate JSON Schema before handler
    - AuditLayer — log tool calls for observability
```

**Implementation approach:**

```rust
// Define a request/response pair for LLM
pub struct LlmCall {
    pub request: LlmRequest,
}

pub struct LlmCallResponse {
    pub response: LlmResponse,
}

// Implement tower::Service for each LlmPort provider
impl tower::Service<LlmCall> for OllamaProvider {
    type Response = LlmCallResponse;
    type Error = RusvelError;
    type Future = Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>> + Send>>;

    fn poll_ready(&mut self, _cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Result<(), Self::Error>> {
        Poll::Ready(Ok(()))
    }

    fn call(&mut self, req: LlmCall) -> Self::Future {
        // ... actual LLM call
    }
}
```

---

#### Facade Decomposition (GoF: Facade) — AppState Breakup

**Problem:** `AppState` in `rusvel-api` holds ~25 fields. Every handler receives the entire state. This creates implicit coupling — a chat handler has access to the deployment port.

**Solution:** Split `AppState` into focused sub-states. Each handler group receives only the sub-state it needs.

```
[ ] CoreState — storage, events, sessions, config, auth (used by all handlers)
[ ] AgentState — agent_runtime, tools, memory, profile (used by chat/agent handlers)
[ ] EngineState — forge, code_engine, content_engine, harvest_engine, gtm_engine, flow_engine
[ ] InfraState — terminal, cdp, deploy, channel, webhook_receiver, cron_scheduler
[ ] BootState — registry, boot_time, failed_departments (read-only after boot)
```

```rust
// Before: every handler gets everything
async fn handle_chat(State(state): State<Arc<AppState>>) -> impl IntoResponse { ... }

// After: handlers declare their dependencies
async fn handle_chat(
    State(core): State<Arc<CoreState>>,
    State(agent): State<Arc<AgentState>>,
) -> impl IntoResponse { ... }
```

**Implementation:**

```
[ ] Define sub-state structs in rusvel-api
[ ] Use Axum's FromRef pattern to extract sub-states from a parent AppState
[ ] Migrate handlers one module at a time (start with chat, then departments, then system)
[ ] Remove fields from handlers that don't need them
```

---

#### Composite Pattern (GoF: Composite) — Flow Node Hierarchy

**Problem:** Flow engine nodes (code, condition, agent) are flat. No way to nest sub-flows, group nodes, or compose workflows.

**Solution:** Make `FlowNode` a composite — a node can contain a sub-flow (DAG of nodes).

```rust
pub enum FlowNode {
    Code(CodeNode),
    Condition(ConditionNode),
    Agent(AgentNode),
    BrowserTrigger(BrowserTriggerNode),
    BrowserAction(BrowserActionNode),
    SubFlow(SubFlowNode),       // NEW: contains a nested FlowDefinition
    Parallel(ParallelNode),      // NEW: fan-out to N nodes, fan-in results
    Loop(LoopNode),              // NEW: repeat until condition met
}

pub struct SubFlowNode {
    pub flow_id: FlowId,        // Reference to another flow definition
    pub input_mapping: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub output_mapping: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Add SubFlowNode, ParallelNode, LoopNode variants to FlowNode enum
[ ] Implement recursive execution in flow-engine executor
[ ] Add cycle detection for SubFlow references (prevent infinite recursion)
[ ] Add depth limit (e.g., max 5 levels of nesting)
[ ] Update flow-engine/src/lib.rs NodeRegistry to handle new types
[ ] Update API: GET /api/flows/node-types to include new variants
[ ] Update frontend WorkflowBuilder to render nested flows
```

---

### 4.3 Behavioral patterns

#### Strategy with Static Dispatch (GoF: Strategy)

**Problem:** All strategy selection is via `Arc<dyn Trait>` (dynamic dispatch). For hot paths where the strategy set is closed and known, this adds unnecessary vtable overhead.

**Solution:** Use generic type parameters for closed strategy sets; keep `dyn Trait` for open sets.

**Closed sets (use generics):**

```
[ ] ModelTier routing — only 3 tiers (Fast/Balanced/Premium)
    - Replace runtime match with generic: fn route<T: TierStrategy>(tier: T, request: LlmRequest)

[ ] Content platform adapters — known set (LinkedIn, Twitter, DEV.to)
    - Replace Vec<Box<dyn PlatformAdapter>> with enum dispatch for known platforms
    - Keep Box<dyn PlatformAdapter> for user-added platforms via MCP

[ ] Flow condition evaluation — known evaluators
    - Replace dynamic dispatch with enum: ConditionEvaluator { JsonPath, Expression, LlmJudge }
```

**Open sets (keep dyn Trait):**

```
LlmPort — new providers can be added
DepartmentApp — new departments can be added
ToolHandler — user-defined tools
EventHandler — department-defined handlers
```

**Principle:** If the set of strategies is fixed and known at compile time, use enum dispatch. If the set is open (user-extensible), use trait objects.

---

#### Observer with Typed Channels (GoF: Observer)

**Problem:** `EventPort` broadcasts untyped `Event` structs. Subscribers must pattern-match on `event.kind` string. No compile-time guarantee that a subscriber handles the right event type.

**Solution:** Add a typed event channel layer on top of the existing string-based EventPort.

```rust
// Typed event wrapper (zero-cost at runtime — just a newtype)
pub trait TypedEvent: Send + Sync + 'static {
    const KIND: &'static str;
    fn from_event(event: &Event) -> Result<Self> where Self: Sized;
    fn into_event(self, session_id: SessionId) -> Event;
}

// Example: typed event for code analysis completion
pub struct CodeAnalyzed {
    pub session_id: SessionId,
    pub path: PathBuf,
    pub symbols_found: usize,
}

impl TypedEvent for CodeAnalyzed {
    const KIND: &'static str = "code.analyzed";
    fn from_event(event: &Event) -> Result<Self> { serde_json::from_value(event.data.clone()) }
    fn into_event(self, session_id: SessionId) -> Event { /* construct */ }
}

// Typed subscription
pub trait TypedEventBus {
    fn subscribe<E: TypedEvent>(&self) -> broadcast::Receiver<E>;
    fn emit_typed<E: TypedEvent>(&self, event: E, session_id: SessionId) -> Result<EventId>;
}
```

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Define TypedEvent trait in rusvel-core
[ ] Implement TypedEventBus as a layer on top of EventPort
[ ] Define typed events for the 6 wired engines (code.analyzed, content.drafted, harvest.scored, etc.)
[ ] Migrate engine event subscriptions from string matching to typed subscriptions
[ ] Keep string-based EventPort as the underlying transport (backward compatible)
[ ] Event kind constants as associated consts on TypedEvent (compile-time safe)
```

---

#### Command Pattern Enhancement (GoF: Command)

**Problem:** `JobKind` uses `Custom(String)` for extensibility but loses type safety. Job results are stored in untyped `metadata: serde_json::Value`.

**Solution:** Typed job commands with associated input/output types.

```rust
pub trait JobCommand: Send + Sync + 'static {
    const KIND: &'static str;
    type Input: Serialize + DeserializeOwned;
    type Output: Serialize + DeserializeOwned;

    fn kind(&self) -> &str { Self::KIND }
    fn input(&self) -> &Self::Input;
}

// Example
pub struct ContentPublishCommand {
    pub content_id: ContentId,
    pub platform: Platform,
}

impl JobCommand for ContentPublishCommand {
    const KIND: &'static str = "content.publish";
    type Input = ContentPublishInput;
    type Output = PublishResult;
    // ...
}
```

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Define JobCommand trait in rusvel-core
[ ] Implement for existing job kinds: CodeAnalyze, ContentPublish, HarvestScan, OutreachSend, Custom
[ ] Type-safe enqueue: job_port.enqueue_typed(command) serializes Input to metadata
[ ] Type-safe complete: job_port.complete_typed::<C>(job_id, output) serializes Output
[ ] Migrate job worker dispatch to typed commands
[ ] Keep JobKind::Custom(String) for backward compatibility with untyped jobs
```

---

#### Chain of Responsibility (GoF: Chain) — Middleware Pipeline

**Problem:** API middleware is global. No per-route or per-department middleware chains. Auth, rate limiting, and validation are either on or off for all routes.

**Solution:** Use Axum's nested router pattern with per-group middleware.

```
[ ] Department routes: auth + rate limit + department context injection
[ ] System routes: auth + admin check
[ ] Health routes: no auth, no rate limit
[ ] Chat/SSE routes: auth + SSE-specific timeout + backpressure
[ ] Webhook routes: HMAC verification middleware (not bearer token)
```

```rust
let dept_routes = Router::new()
    .route("/api/dept/:id/chat", post(chat_handler))
    .route("/api/dept/:id/goals", get(list_goals).post(create_goal))
    .layer(DepartmentContextLayer::new())
    .layer(RateLimitLayer::new(100));

let webhook_routes = Router::new()
    .route("/api/webhooks/:id/receive", post(receive_webhook))
    .layer(HmacVerificationLayer::new());

let app = Router::new()
    .merge(dept_routes)
    .merge(webhook_routes)
    .route("/api/health", get(health_handler))  // no middleware
    .layer(TracingLayer::new());
```

---

#### Visitor Pattern (GoF: Visitor) — Code Engine AST

**Problem:** `code-engine` symbol graph traversal is hardcoded. Adding a new analysis pass (e.g., complexity metrics, dependency mapping) requires modifying the traversal code.

**Solution:** Define a `SymbolVisitor` trait. Traversal walks the graph and calls visitor methods. New analyses implement the visitor trait.

```rust
pub trait SymbolVisitor {
    fn visit_module(&mut self, module: &Module) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    fn visit_function(&mut self, func: &Function) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    fn visit_struct(&mut self, s: &Struct) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    fn visit_trait(&mut self, t: &Trait) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    fn visit_impl(&mut self, i: &Impl) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
    fn visit_import(&mut self, import: &Import) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }
}

// Traversal (unchanged when new visitors are added)
pub fn walk_symbol_graph<V: SymbolVisitor>(graph: &SymbolGraph, visitor: &mut V) -> Result<()> {
    for module in &graph.modules {
        visitor.visit_module(module)?;
        for func in &module.functions {
            visitor.visit_function(func)?;
        }
        // ... etc
    }
    Ok(())
}

// New analysis = new visitor (Open/Closed principle)
pub struct ComplexityVisitor { pub total_complexity: usize }
impl SymbolVisitor for ComplexityVisitor { /* count branches per function */ }

pub struct DependencyVisitor { pub edges: Vec<(String, String)> }
impl SymbolVisitor for DependencyVisitor { /* track import relationships */ }
```

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Define SymbolVisitor trait in code-engine
[ ] Implement walk_symbol_graph() traversal function
[ ] Refactor existing metric calculation as MetricsVisitor
[ ] Refactor existing search indexing as SearchIndexVisitor
[ ] Add ComplexityVisitor for cyclomatic complexity
[ ] Add DependencyVisitor for import graph extraction
```

---

#### State Pattern with Typestate (GoF: State)

**Problem:** `JobStatus` transitions are unchecked at compile time. Code can call `complete()` on a job that's already completed. `FlowExecution` status transitions are similarly unchecked.

**Solution:** Typestate for finite state machines where invalid transitions should be impossible.

```rust
// Job state machine (compile-time safe)
pub struct Job<S: JobState> {
    pub id: JobId,
    pub kind: JobKind,
    pub session_id: SessionId,
    _state: PhantomData<S>,
    data: JobData,  // shared internal data
}

pub struct Queued;
pub struct Running;
pub struct AwaitingApproval;
pub struct Completed;
pub struct Failed;

// Only Queued jobs can be started
impl Job<Queued> {
    pub fn start(self) -> Job<Running> { /* transition */ }
    pub fn cancel(self) -> Job<Failed> { /* transition */ }
}

// Only Running jobs can complete or fail
impl Job<Running> {
    pub fn complete(self, result: serde_json::Value) -> Job<Completed> { /* transition */ }
    pub fn fail(self, error: String) -> Job<Failed> { /* transition */ }
    pub fn hold_for_approval(self) -> Job<AwaitingApproval> { /* transition */ }
}

// Only AwaitingApproval jobs can be approved
impl Job<AwaitingApproval> {
    pub fn approve(self) -> Job<Queued> { /* back to queue */ }
    pub fn reject(self) -> Job<Failed> { /* transition */ }
}
```

**Scope:** Apply to `Job` and `FlowExecution` state machines. Do NOT apply to domain entities with >5 states or dynamic state sets.

**When NOT to use:** If the state machine must be serialized/deserialized across process boundaries (the typestate is erased by serde). In that case, use a runtime-checked `Status` enum with a `transition()` method that validates transitions.

**Practical approach for RUSVEL:** Use typestate internally within a single function's scope (the job worker loop). Use runtime-checked `JobStatus` enum for persistence and API responses.

```
[ ] Define typestate Job<S> for internal job worker logic
[ ] Keep JobStatus enum for persistence layer (serde-compatible)
[ ] Add Job::transition(from: JobStatus, to: JobStatus) -> Result<()> with explicit validation
[ ] Define allowed transitions as a static map
[ ] Return descriptive error on invalid transition
```

#### Mediator Pattern (GoF: Mediator) — Cross-Department Agent Delegation

**Problem:** ForgeEngine is the "meta-engine" but cannot delegate tasks to other department agents. Cross-department coordination requires manual event chains.

**Solution:** A `DelegateAgent` tool that ForgeEngine can use to invoke another department's agent with a scoped prompt.

```rust
pub struct DelegateAgentTool {
    agent_port: Arc<dyn AgentPort>,
    tool_registry: Arc<dyn ToolPort>,
    department_registry: Arc<DepartmentRegistry>,
}

impl DelegateAgentTool {
    pub async fn execute(&self, args: DelegateArgs) -> Result<ToolOutput> {
        // 1. Validate target department exists
        let dept = self.department_registry.get(&args.department_id)?;

        // 2. Create scoped tool set for target department
        let scoped_tools = ScopedToolRegistry::new(
            self.tool_registry.clone(),
            &dept.manifest().tools,
        );

        // 3. Run agent with department's system prompt + delegated task
        let config = AgentConfig::builder()
            .session_id(args.session_id)
            .system_prompt(format!("{}\n\nDelegated task: {}", dept.manifest().system_prompt, args.task))
            .build();

        let result = self.agent_port.run(config, scoped_tools).await?;
        Ok(ToolOutput::from(result))
    }
}
```

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Define DelegateAgentTool in rusvel-builtin-tools or rusvel-engine-tools
[ ] Register as a forge-only tool (not available to other departments)
[ ] Add depth limit (max 3 delegation levels to prevent infinite recursion)
[ ] Emit event: forge.agent.delegated with target department and task
[ ] Add delegation tracking in AgentEvent stream (show delegation in chat UI)
```

## 5. SOLID principle alignment

### Current compliance and gaps

| Principle | Status | Gap | Refactoring |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------------|
| **S** — Single Responsibility | Good | `AppState` holds 25+ concerns. `rusvel-cli` repeats dept variants 9x | Sprint 3: AppState breakup. Sprint 10: CLI data-driven dispatch |
| **O** — Open/Closed | Excellent | DepartmentApp is perfectly OCP. Tool registry is mostly OCP | Sprint 4: SymbolVisitor for code-engine. Sprint 7: WASM plugin boundary |
| **L** — Liskov Substitution | Good | Port trait contracts are implicit (documented, not enforced) | Sprint 4: Engine contract tests (from testing plan). Sprint 1: Port trait documentation |
| **I** — Interface Segregation | Excellent | StoragePort → 5 sub-stores (ADR-004). Ports are focused | Sprint 3: AppState sub-states extend ISP to API layer |
| **D** — Dependency Inversion | Excellent | Engines → traits only (ADR-010). Composition root wires concretes | Sprint 2: PlatformFactory formalizes the pattern |

### Specific ISP improvements

```
[ ] Split EventPort into EventEmitter + EventQuerier
    - Engines that only emit don't need query methods
    - EventEmitter: emit()
    - EventQuerier: get(), query()
    - EventPort: extends both (for backward compatibility)

[ ] Split ToolPort into ToolRegistry + ToolExecutor
    - Registration (boot-time) vs execution (runtime) are separate concerns
    - ToolRegistry: register(), deregister(), list()
    - ToolExecutor: call(), search()
    - ToolPort: extends both

[ ] Split AgentPort into AgentRunner + AgentStreamRunner
    - Sync run() vs streaming run_streaming() are different use cases
    - Some callers (job worker) only need sync
    - Some callers (chat handler) only need streaming
```

## 6. Modern system design patterns

### 6.1 Domain-Driven Design refinements

**Current state:** RUSVEL has implicit DDD. Domain types are in `rusvel-core`, engines are use-case interactors, events are domain events. But aggregates are not explicit, and there's no aggregate root enforcement.

**Refactoring:**

```
[ ] Define Aggregate Root marker trait
    pub trait AggregateRoot {
        type Id: Clone + Eq + Hash;
        fn id(&self) -> &Self::Id;
    }

[ ] Mark aggregate roots:
    - Session is aggregate root for Runs and Threads
    - Opportunity is aggregate root for Proposals
    - ContentItem is aggregate root for PublishResults
    - Contact is aggregate root for OutreachSteps
    - Workflow is aggregate root for Nodes and Edges
    - Goal is aggregate root for Tasks

[ ] Add ObjectStore association edges (Sprint 5)
    pub trait ObjectStore {
        // Existing CRUD...
        async fn relate(&self, from_kind: &str, from_id: &str, to_kind: &str, to_id: &str, relation: &str) -> Result<()>;
        async fn related(&self, kind: &str, id: &str, relation: &str) -> Result<Vec<serde_json::Value>>;
        async fn unrelate(&self, from_kind: &str, from_id: &str, to_kind: &str, to_id: &str, relation: &str) -> Result<()>;
    }

    Implementation: SQLite junction table
    CREATE TABLE object_relations (
        from_kind TEXT NOT NULL,
        from_id TEXT NOT NULL,
        to_kind TEXT NOT NULL,
        to_id TEXT NOT NULL,
        relation TEXT NOT NULL,
        created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
        PRIMARY KEY (from_kind, from_id, to_kind, to_id, relation)
    );

    Usage:
    store.objects().relate("contact", contact_id, "opportunity", opp_id, "sourced_from").await?;
    let opps = store.objects().related("contact", contact_id, "sourced_from").await?;
```

### 6.2 Event architecture — Saga pattern

**Problem:** Multi-step business flows (harvest → proposal → outreach → invoice) have no compensation logic. A failure mid-flow leaves orphaned state.

**Solution:** Model multi-step flows as sagas in flow-engine with compensation edges.

```rust
pub struct SagaStep {
    pub action_node_id: NodeId,
    pub compensation_node_id: Option<NodeId>,  // Reverse action on failure
}

pub struct SagaDefinition {
    pub steps: Vec<SagaStep>,  // Ordered
    pub on_complete: Option<NodeId>,
    pub on_failure: Option<NodeId>,
}
```

**Execution semantics:**
1. Execute steps in order (or in DAG order if parallel)
2. On failure at step N: execute compensation for steps N-1, N-2, ..., 1 in reverse
3. Compensation is best-effort (log failures, don't retry infinitely)

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Add SagaStep and SagaDefinition to flow-engine
[ ] Add compensation edge type to FlowNode graph
[ ] Implement reverse-order compensation execution
[ ] Store saga state in flow checkpoints
[ ] Emit events: flow.saga.step_completed, flow.saga.compensating, flow.saga.compensated
[ ] Define compensation actions for existing pipelines:
    - Harvest → Content: on content failure, mark opportunity as "draft_failed"
    - GTM outreach: on send failure, revert contact status to "pending"
```

### 6.3 Event projections (lightweight CQRS)

**Problem:** Reading domain state requires querying ObjectStore + joining with Events for timeline. No pre-computed read models.

**Solution:** Lightweight projections — event subscribers that maintain denormalized read views.

```rust
pub trait Projection: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn handles(&self) -> &[&str];  // Event kinds this projection processes
    async fn apply(&self, event: &Event, store: &dyn ObjectStore) -> Result<()>;
}

// Example: Department activity feed projection
pub struct DepartmentActivityProjection;

impl Projection for DepartmentActivityProjection {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "department_activity" }
    fn handles(&self) -> &[&str] { &["code.analyzed", "content.drafted", "harvest.scored", "gtm.outreach.sent"] }

    async fn apply(&self, event: &Event, store: &dyn ObjectStore) -> Result<()> {
        // Write a denormalized activity entry to ObjectStore
        let activity = json!({
            "department": extract_dept(event),
            "action": event.kind,
            "summary": extract_summary(event),
            "timestamp": event.created_at,
        });
        store.put("department_activity", &Uuid::now_v7().to_string(), &activity).await
    }
}
```

**Checklist:**

```
[ ] Define Projection trait in rusvel-core
[ ] Register projections during department boot (alongside event subscriptions)
[ ] Wire projection execution in event dispatch (after primary handler, non-blocking)
[ ] Implement DepartmentActivityProjection — feeds the dashboard
[ ] Implement PipelineStatusProjection — feeds the GTM pipeline view
[ ] Implement CostProjection — aggregates LLM costs by department/session
[ ] Add GET /api/dept/:id/activity endpoint reading from projection store
```

### 6.4 Capability-based tool access

**Current:** `ScopedToolRegistry` filters tools by department prefix. This is a visibility boundary, not a security boundary.

**Improvement:** Per-agent-run capability tokens.

```
[ ] Generate a RunCapability token at agent run start
    - Contains: run_id, session_id, department_id, allowed_tool_patterns, expiry
    - Signed with a per-session HMAC key

[ ] Tool execution checks capability token
    - Token must be valid, not expired, and tool must match allowed patterns
    - Prevents tool replay attacks (token is single-use per run)

[ ] Log capability grants and exercises for audit trail
```

**Priority:** Low for single-user. Essential before multi-user or if agents can spawn sub-agents.

[ ] 10.5 CORS configuration from config
    File: crates/rusvel-api/src/lib.rs
    - Move CORS origins to ConfigPort: config("api.cors_origins", ["http://localhost:5173"])
    - Support wildcard for development: config("api.cors_allow_all", false)

## 18. Sprint 11 — Frontend architecture alignment

> Goal: Apply patterns to frontend that mirror backend architecture.

### Exit criteria

- [ ] API client uses typed response interfaces (not `any`)
- [ ] Store pattern follows command/query separation
- [ ] Component hierarchy mirrors concept hierarchy
- [ ] Department manifest drives navigation (already partially done)

### Detailed checklist

```
[ ] 11.1 Typed API client
    File: frontend/src/lib/api.ts
    - Define TypeScript interfaces for ALL API response types
    - Each API function returns typed response (not Promise<any>)
    - Use zod or io-ts for runtime response validation (optional)
    - Group API functions by domain: sessions, departments, chat, flows, etc.

[ ] 11.2 Command/Query store separation
    File: frontend/src/lib/stores/
    - Split stores into queries (read) and commands (write)
    - Queries: derived stores that auto-refresh from API
    - Commands: action functions that mutate state and invalidate queries
    - Pattern mirrors CQRS from backend

[ ] 11.3 Component hierarchy alignment
    - Shell components → Level 0 (Platform)
    - Session components → Level 1 (Session)
    - Department components → Level 2 (Department)
    - Entity components → Level 3 (Domain entities)
    - Primitive UI components → shared across all levels

[ ] 11.4 Department-driven routing
    - Verify /dept/[id] route loads manifest from API
    - All department-specific UI generated from manifest (tabs, actions, tools)
    - Adding a department requires zero frontend changes (already partially true)

[ ] 11.5 Error boundary per department
    - Each department page wrapped in Svelte error boundary
    - Department failure doesn't crash the whole app
    - Show department-specific error state with retry
```

## 19. Sprint 12 — Self-improving system feedback loops

> Goal: Close the loop — agent failures generate skills, successful patterns accumulate.

### Exit criteria

- [ ] Failed agent runs trigger reflection analysis
- [ ] Reflection generates skill/rule suggestions stored in ObjectStore
- [ ] Successful tool call sequences persisted as reusable skill templates
- [ ] Benchmark gating: auto-approve agents that pass test set

### Detailed checklist

```
[ ] 12.1 Failure reflection loop
    File: crates/forge-engine/src/reflection.rs (new)
    - On agent run failure (AgentEvent::Error or empty result):
      1. Emit event: forge.run.failed with full transcript
      2. Hook triggers reflection agent
      3. Reflection agent analyzes transcript with prompt:
         "What went wrong? What skill or rule would prevent this?"
      4. Output: suggested Skill or Rule stored as draft in ObjectStore
      5. Human reviews draft in approval queue

[ ] 12.2 Skill accumulation from success
    File: crates/forge-engine/src/skill_miner.rs (new)
    - On agent run success with tool calls:
      1. Extract tool call sequence as a "recipe"
      2. If recipe matches no existing skill → suggest new skill
      3. If recipe matches existing skill → increment success counter
      4. Skills with high success count → auto-promote to default

[ ] 12.3 Experience replay for prompting
    File: crates/rusvel-agent/src/context.rs (extend)
    - Before agent run: query MemoryPort for similar past successes
    - Inject 1-2 successful trajectories as few-shot examples
    - Track which examples were used → correlate with success/failure

[ ] 12.4 Benchmark gating for auto-approval
    File: crates/rusvel-jobs/src/approval.rs (new or extend)
    - Define "test set" per department: known inputs with expected outputs
    - Before auto-approving a job, run agent on test set
    - If test set passes → auto-approve
    - If test set fails → hold for human approval
    - Configurable per department via DepartmentManifest.config_schema
```

## 20. Anti-patterns to avoid

| Anti-pattern | Why it's tempting | Why it's wrong for RUSVEL |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Full actor framework** (actix actors) | Clean message passing | Adds complexity without benefit at single-binary scale. `tokio::spawn` + channels is sufficient |
| **Full event sourcing** (aggregate reconstitution from events) | Perfect audit trail | High query complexity. ObjectStore + EventPort combination is appropriate until audit trails are explicitly required |
| **Dynamic `.so` plugin loading** | Hot-reload departments | Rust has no stable ABI. Single binary is strictly superior. Use WASM if needed |
| **Generic trait bounds on stored structs** | Avoids vtable overhead | Monomorphization across 54 crates causes compile time bloat. Prefer `Arc<dyn Trait>` |
| **Typestate everywhere** | Compile-time state safety | More than ~5 states becomes unmaintainable. Typestate can't survive serde boundaries. Use for internal hot paths only |
| **Global static singletons** | Easy access to shared state | Breaks testability. Pass `Arc<T>` via constructors |
| **Premature abstraction** | "What if we need to..." | Build for today's 14 departments, not hypothetical 100. Extract patterns after 3+ instances |
| **Over-sealed traits** | Prevent misuse | RUSVEL's ports should be implementable by adapters in the workspace. Seal only if publishing as external library |
| **DI container/framework** | "Spring for Rust" | Rust's type system + composition root is the DI framework. No reflection needed |
| **Microservices** | Independent deployment | RUSVEL's value proposition is ONE binary. Split only at extreme scale (>100K users) |

## 21. Success metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| String literals for event kinds | ~40 | 0 | `grep -r '"[a-z]*\.[a-z]*"' crates/` excluding tests |
| Tool name collisions at boot | Silent | Error | Boot validation |
| Invalid job transitions (runtime) | Possible | Impossible (in hot path) | Typestate audit |
| AppState fields | ~25 | 5 sub-states × ~5 fields | Count struct fields |
| Port middleware layers (tower) | 0 | 3+ (cost, timeout, logging) | Count Layer impls |
| Association graph queries | 0 | Available on ObjectStore | API test |
| Projections running | 0 | 3+ (activity, pipeline, cost) | Boot log |
| Agent delegation depth support | 0 | Max 3 levels | Config + test |
| Flow checkpoint/resume | No | Yes | Integration test |
| Saga compensation | No | Yes | Integration test |
| Frontend typed API responses | ~10% | 100% | TypeScript strict mode errors |
| Magic numbers in code | ~10 | 0 (all in ConfigPort) | `grep` for numeric literals in non-test code |
| Self-improvement feedback loops | 0 | 2 (failure reflection + skill mining) | Feature flag check |
| Build cache hit rate | 0% | >60% | sccache stats |
